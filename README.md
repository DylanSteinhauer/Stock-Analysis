# An Analysis of Green Energy Stocks
We analyzed various green energy stocks for Steve's parents, who were initially interested in DQ. 
## Recommendations
I recommend that Steve's parents stay clear from DQ stock. It had massive losses in both 2017 and 2018. This was the case for many of the stocks we looked at. I recommend investing in either ENPH or RUN. ENPH had big gains in 2017 (129.5% growth) and 2018 (81.9%). In addition, RUN had 5.5% growth in 2017 and 84% in 2018.
